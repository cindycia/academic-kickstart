abstract: "Cooperative dual-crane lifting is an challenging and critical task in industrial sites.
In this paper, we aim to automatically generate
optimized dual-crane lifting paths under highly complex constraints, i.e.,
collision avoidance, coordination between the two cranes, and
balance of the lifting target. 
We propose a mathematical modeling of the cooperative lifting system. Based on the formulation, we devleop a massively parallel solver based on a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm to compute highly-optimized lifting trajectories that satisfy continous collision-avoidance, coordination, and load-balancing constraints in complex industrial envirnoments.
Our results show that the planner generate lifting paths that are safe, efficient, and
easy for conduction for any complex
environments."
