abstract: "Autonomous driving in an unregulated urban
crowd is an outstanding challenge, especially, in the presence
of many aggressive, high-speed traffic participants. This paper
presents SUMMIT, a high-fidelity simulator that facilitates
the development and testing of crowd-driving algorithms. By
leveraging the open-source OpenStreetMap map database and a
heterogeneous multi-agent motion prediction model developed
in our earlier work, SUMMIT simulates dense, unregulated
urban traffic for heterogeneous agents at any worldwide loca-
tions that OpenStreetMap supports. SUMMIT is built as an
extension of CARLA and inherits from it the physical and
visual realism for autonomous driving simulation. SUMMIT
supports a wide range of applications, including perception,
vehicle control and planning, end-to-end learning. We provide
a context-aware planner together with benchmark scenarios
and show that SUMMIT generates complex, realistic traffic
behaviors in challenging crowd-driving settings."
