abstract: "This paper presents a planning system for autonomous driving among many pedestrians. A key ingredient of
our approach is PORCA, a pedestrian motion prediction model
that accounts for both a pedestrian’s global navigation intention
and local interactions with the vehicle and other pedestrians.
Unfortunately, the autonomous vehicle does not know the pedestrians’ intentions a priori and requires a planning algorithm
that hedges against the uncertainty in pedestrian intentions.
Our planning system combines a POMDP algorithm with the
pedestrian motion model and runs in real time. Experiments
show that it enables a robot scooter to drive safely, efficiently,
and smoothly in a crowd with a density of nearly one person per
square meter"
