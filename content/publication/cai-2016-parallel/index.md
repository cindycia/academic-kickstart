abstract: "Heavy lifting is a common and important task in industrial plants. It is conducted frequently during the time of
plant construction, maintenance shutdown and new equipment installation. To find a safe and cost effective
way of lifting, a team works for weeks or even months doing site investigation, planning and evaluations. This
paper considers the lifting path planning problem for terrain cranes in complex environments. The lifting path
planning problem takes inputs such as the plant environment, crane mechanical data, crane position, start and
end lifting configurations to generate the optimal lifting path by evaluating costs and safety risks. We formulate
the crane lifting path planning as a multi-objective nonlinear integer optimization problem with implicit
constraints. It aims to optimize the energy cost, time cost and human operation conformity of the lifting path
under constraints of collision avoidance and operational limitations. To solve the optimization problem, we
design a Masterâ€“Slave Parallel Genetic Algorithm and implement the algorithm on Graphics Processing Units
using CUDA programming. In order to handle complex plants, we propose a collision detection strategy using
hybrid configuration spaces based on an image-based collision detection algorithm. The results show that the
method can efficiently generate high quality lifting paths in complex environments"
