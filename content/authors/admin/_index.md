I am a roboticist. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow working with [Prof. David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) at the Department of Computer Science, [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) after receiving my PhD degree from the Nayang Technological University. I have been focusing on tackling large-scale decision making problems in robotics that involve complex environments, uncertainties and long-term planning. My research interests include robot motion planning, decision making, robot learning, parallel computing, and their applications to autonomous driving in crowded environments. My goal is to enable robots to seamlessly interact with humans in crowded, chaotic environments and accomplish complex tasks.
