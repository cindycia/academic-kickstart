abstract: "Autonomous driving in mixed traffic requires
reliably predicting the motion of nearby traffic agents, such
as pedestrians, bicycles, cars, buses, etc. . This prediction task
is extremely challenging, because of the diverse geometry and
dynamics of traffic agents, multi-way interactions among them,
and complex road conditions. This paper presents GAMMA,
a general agent motion prediction model for autonomous
driving. GAMMA predicts the motion of heterogeneous traffic
agents with different geometric, kinematics, and behavioral
constraints. It formalizes motion prediction as constrained
geometric optimization in the velocity space and integrates both
physical and behavioral constraints into a unified framework.
Our results show that GAMMA outperforms state-of-the-art
motion prediction methods substantially on real-world datasets/"
